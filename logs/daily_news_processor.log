      "reason": "The Structural RCC frame (\u20b915,000,000) is supplied by Tata Steel. According to recent news: 'Tata steel price increase by 10% in major cities.' This creates direct cost impact because the increase in material prices will raise project costs significantly. The potential impact includes an increase of \u20b91,500,000 in costs for the structural frame.",
      "suggestion": "Immediately contact Tata Steel to discuss the price increase and explore options for locking in current rates. Assess alternative suppliers for structural steel within 7 days to mitigate potential cost increases. Monitor Tata Steel's pricing updates weekly. Prepare to adjust project budgets if the price increase is implemented. Expected outcome: Cost control and budget adherence.",

This creates a cost-saving opportunity because the reduction in material prices will lower project costs. The potential impact includes a decrease of \u20b9800,000 in costs for the foundation.",
      "suggestion": "Immediately update the project costing to reflect the new lower rates for Ultratech Cement. Lock in the new pricing for foundation materials within 3 days to capture savings.
